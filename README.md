# Open-Democracy
With everything in the world going to shit because of some old law or another that was never ratified or was taken advantage of to either force an authoritarian to take control or for big companies to get what ever law they want. Sometimes its just to delay something for months or even years.

Looking at history, most democracies were governed by the rich, since they were the only ones who had the time, education and money to go into politics. However in our age, the number of educated people is much higher, people have more time and most importantly, technology connects us all. Which brings us to this experiment. If people can get together to create software that truly fills a need through Open Source and generaly keep it good quality, what else can we do that could fill a need and that can bring people together? Politics can be a boring subjects, and daunting when you realize how greasy a pole you have to climb to actually make a change. However on a platform such as GitHub, where every ones voice can be heard, be it in raising issues, making a change, or contributing to the discussion, a democracy that truly incorporates everyone's needs can be acheived. This, in theory, should not be able to be discriminatory in any sense.

This being said, this is an experiment that is not linked to any real form of government, but perhaps it can eventually lead to change. Let's see where this can go!
